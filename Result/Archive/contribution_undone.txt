This paper contributes to a large literature on retirement timing and highlights heterogeneous effects by financial literacy, wealth and health condition. 
Seibold (2021), for example, use the bunching method to investigate retirement responses to over 600 benefit discontinuities based on administrative data from the German public pension system. 
Their finding implies statutory retirement schedules have direct effect on retirement decisions, which are bigger than financial incentives themselves. 
And they argue reference dependence might be the mechanism driving this empirical patterns. 

It also contributes to literature on the effect of retirement on health.  
In particular, Zamarro (2011) study the health impacts of retirement in 11 countries using the Survey of Health, Ageingand Retirement in Europe(SHARE) datasets. 
They exploit statutory retirement ages as instruments for retiring and examine self-reported health information and other objective health diagnoses.
The estimates provide significant evidence that retirement has positive effects on health and cognitive function.
